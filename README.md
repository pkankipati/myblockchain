Create a private blockchain from scratch on your local desktop. Start multiple nodes on your local box and test with postman.

Before you get started…
Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that they’re chained together using hashes.
